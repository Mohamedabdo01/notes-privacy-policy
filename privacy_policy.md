##Privacy Policy

At Notes app, we value the privacy and safety of our users' data and commit to complying with User-Generated Content (UGC) regulations concerning the storage and protection of personal data. This policy outlines the information we collect, the methods we use to collect and store it, the parties who can access it, and the ways in which users can control the use of their personal data.

##Data We Collect:
 We collect data that is sent to us when the app is used, including user backups and public posts added to our databases. This data is collected voluntarily.
 No personal data is collected when publishing a public post.
 No personal data other than the email address and fully encrypted data with the user's password is collected when using the backup service.
 The profile picture is collected when publishing a public post, and the account name previously registered is also collected. These data are not used for anything other than displaying them in the public post.

##Public Posts Usage Policies:
 Please note that any public post cannot be deleted or edited, nor can it be reverted once published.
 Please do not publish any personal information, such as phone numbers, passwords, or personal accounts.
 We are not responsible for any personal data mistakenly published.
 Please do not publish any sexually explicit or inappropriate posts, cyberbullying, or posts that contradict general ethics or religions.
 Posts that violate these guidelines will be subject to removal.

##Data Usage:
 We use public post data to improve the user experience and prevent the publication of posts that violate general ethics or are sexually explicit.

##Sharing with Others:
 We do not share users' personal data with anyone outside the app, unless explicit consent is obtained from users.
 We do not share backup data, and we are not authorized to modify, delete, or use data that is backed up in our databases.

##Data Confidentiality:
 We keep the personal data of users strictly confidential and take necessary measures to protect it from unauthorized access.
 Backup data is fully encrypted using AES technology with a user-generated password, and we cannot access it in any way.
 Only the user can restore it if the password can decrypt the data.

##Removing posts that violate public ethics:
 We reserve the right to delete any post that does not comply with public ethics, without notifying the owner of the post, in any way.

##Retention period for data:
 Public posts are kept for an unspecified period.
 The backup data is kept in our database until the user requests to delete it.

##Right to access and modify:
 No public post can be modified or deleted once published.
 It is not possible to access or delete the latest backup copy that has been uploaded to our databases, which is deleted and replaced only with the latest one.          However, you can request complete deletion by contacting us at the email address below:
  mmklmaok@gmail.com.

##Reporting offensive posts to users:
 If you find a post that is harassing, directly insulting your beliefs, sexual content, or insulting children, you can report such offensive posts by clicking the Report button below the post. In this case, if the post violates public ethics or the cases we have identified previously, the post will be deleted and necessary actions will be taken.

##Protection:
 The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that there is no 100% secure method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

##Changes to this privacy policy:
 This privacy policy is effective as of 02/03/2023 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.
 We reserve the right to update or change our privacy policy at any time, and you should review this privacy policy periodically.
 If we make any material changes to this privacy policy, we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us, or by placing a prominent notice on our application.
